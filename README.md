## Topics 

- Formal definitions of computation, languages and computability
- Models of Computation: finite state automata, pushdown automata, grammars and Turing machines; deterministic and non-deterministic machines
- The Halting Problem, reductions, and NP-completeness
- Dealing with intractability (if time permits)

## Outcomes

- understand and analyze when it is possible to solve a problem computationally
- understand and prove when a problem is undecidable
- understand and illustrate how limitations on computational resources limit the class of problems that can be solved
- understand and apply models of computation for different problems in the Chomsky hierarchy
- characterize and analyze computational problems that are tractable
- characterize and prove computational problems that are intractable
- characterize the class of problems solvable in a model
- understand what it means for models of computation to be equivalent
- understand and apply reductions to prove intractability and undecidability of problems
- transform an automaton into a different equivalent representation, and vice versa

## Handling of late Quizzes and Assignments

To accommodate for potential difficulties keeping deadlines such as illness, note below. Note that **no other accommodations** will be made.

> <u>**Quizzes**</u>
>
> There are 9 **timed** quizzes. Each quiz is available throughout a 24-hour window. Once you start the quiz, you will need to complete it in the given time window.
>
> For quizzes 1 to 8, every student can miss at most one quiz. The weight of the missed quiz will be distributed evenly over the remaining quizzes. For other missed quizzes a grade of 0 will be assigned.

> <u>**Assignments**</u>
>
> There are 5 assignments.
>
> A late penalty of 3% is imposed for every hour of handing in an assignment late. For assignments 1 to 4, every student can miss at most one assignment. The weight of the missed assignment will be distributed evenly over the remaining assignments. For other missed assignments, a grade of 0 will be assigned.

> <u>**Midterms**</u>
>
> There are 2 midterms. Everyone can miss up to one midterm. The weight of the missed midterm will be added onto the weight of the final exam. For another missed midterm, a grade of 0 will be assigned.
